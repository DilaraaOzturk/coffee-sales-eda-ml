# Coffee Sales EDA & Machine Learning ☕️

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing,
and basic machine learning workflows using a coffee sales dataset.

## Dataset Overview ☕
The dataset contains coffee sales records including:
- Date information
- Product and category details
- Sales quantity and revenue-related features

## Project Scope
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Date conversion and feature engineering
- Handling missing values and duplicates
- Encoding categorical variables
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Initial machine learning experiments

## Tools & Libraries ☕
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Datasets
The dataset used in this project is publicly available under the CC0 (Public Domain) license.

Files included in the data/ directory:
- index_1.csv – coffee sales data for the year 2024
- index_2.csv – coffee sales data for the year 2025

Both files share the same structure and are combined during the analysis phase using concatenation to create a unified dataset.

These datasets are used for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning experiments.
